A telegram bot that uses Google's Gemini Pro Vision API , Take a demo [here](https://t.me/visionscriptbot) 

### Gemini Vision Pro

Gemini Pro Vision is a Gemini large language vision model that understands input from text and visual modalities (image and video) in addition to text to generate relevant text responses.

Gemini Pro Vision is a foundation model that performs well at a variety of multimodal tasks such as visual understanding, classification, summarization, and creating content from image and video. It's adept at processing visual and text inputs such as photographs, documents, infographics, and screenshots.
